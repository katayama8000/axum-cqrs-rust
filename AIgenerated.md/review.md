# Review of branch `query-db-mysql-to-redis`

## Summary of Changes

This branch introduces a caching layer using Redis for the query side of the CQRS pattern. The goal is to improve read performance by fetching data from Redis instead of directly from the MySQL database.

The main changes are:

- **Dependencies**: The `redis` crate has been added.
- **Domain Layer**: The `Circle`, `CircleId`, and `Version` structs are now serializable and deserializable, allowing them to be stored in Redis.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: A new `RedisCircleReader` has been implemented to read circle data from Redis.
- **Application Layer**: The application now connects to both MySQL and Redis. The query handler has been updated to use the new `RedisCircleReader`.

## Review

This is a good initiative to improve performance. Using Redis as a cache for the read side is a common and effective pattern in CQRS.

### Good Points

- The query handler now uses `RedisCircleReader`, which should significantly reduce the load on the database and improve response times for read operations.
- Domain objects are now serializable, which is a necessary step for caching.
- The Redis connection is configurable via environment variables.

### Points to Consider

- **Cache Invalidation**: The most critical point is that there doesn't seem to be any cache invalidation logic. When a circle is created or updated, the cache in Redis will become stale. This needs to be addressed. The command side should be responsible for updating or invalidating the Redis cache.
- **Testing**: The `connect_test` function for Redis is currently a `TODO`. It is important to implement this to have proper integration tests for the Redis logic.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling in `redis_circle_reader.rs` is using `anyhow::Error`, which is good for this level of the application.

## Conclusion

The direction of this branch is very positive. However, before merging, it is essential to implement a cache invalidation strategy. Without it, the application will serve stale data.
